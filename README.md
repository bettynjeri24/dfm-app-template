How to clone this project including all its Git Submodules

1. Requirements
For this project to build smoothly, make sure you have been added as a member to these repos:


2. Cloning the project
Run this command on Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac and Linux) i.e inside the directory you want to clone the project
git clone --recurse-submodules https://
Do some small house-keeping using this command
git submodule update
Create your feature branch and checkout into it.

3. Some important contribution guidelines you need to follow
We settled on a few guidelines to avoid errors while generating the app bundle:

For the individual parent repos e.g. dkimani, maintain the base app module to only have the splash screen and Dagger setup (to avoid having to transfer dependencies from the base app module once we fetch the dkimani module onto the mobile banking repo)
For the dynamic feature modules(inside this repo) and modules to be fetched as a submodule from the individual parent repository e.g. dkimani module, rename files in the Resources folder to end with the module suffix i.e.

Drawable e.g. ic_delete_dkimani (additional suffix being dkimani)
Layout e.g. fragment_main_dkimani
Menu e.g. bottom_navigation_dkimani
Navigation e.g. navigation_graph_dkimani
Raw/anim(animation folder) e.g. fingerprint_dkimani
Fonts e.g. nunito_sans_dkimani
